## Overview

This repository contains the OSIAM Connector for Java.

The current version can be found at http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|osiam.

Together with OSIAM it provides an easy to use OAuth2 SCIM based user login for
Java.

## Short OSIAM introduction

OSIAM provides an easy and secure oauth2 standard login of users. It is also
possible to assign users to groups with different roles. It is also possible to
connect to an existing identity provider (like login over facebook).

OSIAM provides three different ways to log in:

- 2 Step login: The consuming application redirects the user to a central Osiam
  Sever where the user can login and the consuming applications granted access
  to the needed user information (for instance if the facebook acount of the
  user is used for login)

- 1 Step login: The user can provide his login and password to your application
  and you can get the security credentials directly from OSIAM without a
  required authorization from the user

- direct login: It is possible to get a security credentials directly from OSIAM
  without the need of any user data

The different ways to login depend on the configured grants in OSIAM.


OSIAM does not depend on any programming language.

It is

- using the OAuth2 standard

- RESTful

- using SCIM 2 to provide JSON-based user management

## OSIAM Connector for Java

The connector4java enables easy and convenient use of OSIAM authentication and
user management in a Java environment.

It provides a easy to use API, a step by step documentation how to set up a test
system and also offers different “ready to go” examples that should enable the
understanding of OSIAM and the connector4java in a short time.

For more information on OSIAM have a look at the
[OSIAM main repository](https://github.com/osiam/osiam).

## Requirements
