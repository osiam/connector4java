# OSIAM Connector4Java

## 1.3.2 - 2014-11-24
- release because of fixes in addon-administration

## 1.3.1 - 2014-10-27
- [fix] fixed creation of auth server by retrieving refresh token

## 1.3 - 2014-10-17
- nothing changed

## 1.2 - 2014-09-30
- [feature] shading all 3rd-party dependencies
  3rd-party dependencies are shaded and packages relocated to eliminate
  possible dependency and jar hell issues. this enables the usage with
  Dropwizard and other projects depending on a different version of JAX-RS
  or Jersey. Note: Because of this you cannot rely on transitive dependencies
  which may have been introduced by the connector to your project. If your
  build goes red after updating to 1.2, just fix your dependencies.

## 1.1 - 2014-09-17
- [feature] revocation of access tokens
  It is now possible to revoke access tokens by using
  OsiamConnector#revokeAccessToken(AccessToken tokenToRevoke) to revoke a
  single access token and
  OsiamConnector#revokeAllAccessTokens(String id, AccessToken accessToken) to
  revoke all access tokens of a given user (the access token supplied to this
  method is for used for authentication).
- [enhancement] updated dependencies: Jersey 2.12, Joda Time 2.4
- [fix] memory leak caused by Jersey client
  Jersey is leaking cloned instaces of
  org.glassfish.jersey.client.ClientConfig.State on each request. see
  https://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2378 for further details.
- [fix] OAuth error message will not be consumed
  In case of an error with OAuth the resulting error message was not consumed
  by the connector, only SCIM errors were.
- [fix] many typos in README.md

## 1.0 - 2014-05-15
Finally released version 1.0 of all important OSIAM projects!
- [enhancement] You can check if an accesstoken is valid
- [enhancement] AccessToken provides additional information about the user it belongs to and the
  expiration date of the refresh token. The AccessToken can be created with a Builder.
- [refactor] The OsiamConnector.Builder doesn't need all information to create an AccessToken. You can set
  the needed information directly in the retrieveAccessToken(...) methods. The OsiamConnector provides one
  retrieveAccessToken-method for each grant

## 0.14 - 2014-04-02
- [enhancement] Raised SCIM-Schema version to 0.41. No migration necessary.
  -> Consider the deprecated API's for getAllExtensions and getAllFields in SCIM-Schema
- [refactoring] OsiamConnector and AccessToken can be extended now,
  because they are not final anymore and the token field in the AccessToken class is protected

  For migration see: https://github.com/osiam/connector4java/wiki/Migration#wiki-from-012-to-013
